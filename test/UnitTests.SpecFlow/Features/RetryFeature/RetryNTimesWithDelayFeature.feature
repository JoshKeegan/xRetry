@retry(2,100)
Feature: Retry N Times With Delay Feature
	In order to allow for transient failures on any test in a feature
	As a QA engineer
	I want to be able to run each scenario in a feature N times, with a delay between each attempt until they pass

Scenario: Retry scenario twice, waiting 100ms between retries when specified on the feature
	When I start the stopwatch if not already started
	Then the elapsed time on the stopwatch is greater than or equal to 90ms

Scenario Outline: Retry scenario outline twice, waiting 100ms between retries when specified on the feature
	When I start the stopwatch for test <n> if not already started
	Then the elapsed time on the stopwatch for test <n> is greater than or equal to 90ms
	Examples:
	| n |
	| 1 |
	| 2 |
