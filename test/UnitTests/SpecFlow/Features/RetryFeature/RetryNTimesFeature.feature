@retry(5)
Feature: Retry N Times Feature
	In order to allow for transient failures on any test in a feature
	As a QA engineer
	I want to be able to run each scenario in a feature N times until they pass

Scenario: Retry scenario five times when specified on the feature
	When I increment the retry count
	Then the result should be 5

Scenario Outline: Retry scenario outline five times when specified on the feature
	When I increment the retry count for test <n>
	Then the retry count for test <n> should be 5
	Examples:
	| n |
	| 1 |
	| 2 |
