@retry
Feature: Retry Feature
	In order to allow for transient failures on any test in a feature
	As a QA engineer
	I want to be able to run each scenario in a feature multiple times until they pass

Scenario: Retry scenario three times by default
	When I increment the retry count
	Then the result should be 3

@ignore
Scenario: Scenario is ignored
	Then fail because this test should have been skipped

Scenario Outline: Retry scenario outline three times by default
	When I increment the retry count for test <n>
	Then the retry count for test <n> should be 3
	Examples:
	| n |
	| 1 |
	| 2 |

@ignore
Scenario Outline: Scenario outline is ignored
	Then fail because this test <n> should have been skipped
	Examples:
	| n |
	| 1 |
	| 2 |

@retry(5)
Scenario: Parameters on the scenario take precedent: retry scenario five times when specified
	When I increment the retry count
	Then the result should be 5

@retry(5)
Scenario Outline: Parameters on the scenario take precedent: retry scenario outline five times when specified
	When I increment the retry count for test <n>
	Then the retry count for test <n> should be 5
	Examples:
	| n |
	| 1 |
	| 2 |
